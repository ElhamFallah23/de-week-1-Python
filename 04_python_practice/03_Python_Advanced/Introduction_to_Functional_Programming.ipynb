    "## 1. What are the Concepts of Functional Programming   \n",
    "### 1.1. Pure Functions\n",
    "It always produces the same output for the same input.\n",
    "It has no side effects. This means it doesn't modify any external state, nor does it perform operations like writing to a file, printing to the console, or modifying a global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A pure function has two key rules:**\n",
    "- **Deterministic:** Same input always gives the same output.\n",
    "- **No Side Effects:** It doesn’t change global state, modify arguments, or do I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use pure functions?**\n",
    "- Easier to test and debug.\n",
    "- Predictable behavior.\n",
    "- Safe for parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Pure vs Impure**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pure_add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b  # Always the same output for the same inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "def impure_add(a):\n",
    "    global total\n",
    "    total += a\n",
    "    return total  # Changes global state (side effect)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Referential Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programs variables once defined do not change their value throughout the program. Referential Transparency is actually a property of expressions and pure functions, meaning an expression can be replaced by its value without changing the program's behavior.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "# x will always be 5; you create a new variable if you need a new value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Functions are First-Class and Can Be Higher-Order\n",
    "\n",
    "First-class functions are treated as first-class variable. The first class variables can be passed to functions as parameter, can be returned from functions or stored in data structures. Higher order functions are the functions that take other functions as arguments and they can also return functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of higher-order functions in Python:**\n",
    "- `map()`\n",
    "- `filter()`\n",
    "- `reduce()` (from `functools`)\n",
    "- Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom higher-order function:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def apply_twice(func, value):\n",
    "    return func(func(value))\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "print(apply_twice(square, 2))  # Output: 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create new variables, but we can’t modify existing variables, and this really helps to maintain state throughout the runtime of a program. Once we create a variable and set its value, we can have full confidence knowing that the value of that variable will never change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def safe_append(original_list, item):\n",
    "    return original_list + [item]  # Returns a new list instead of modifying\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Functional Tools in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python isn’t a purely functional language, but it provides many functional tools:\n",

    "## 2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Advantages of Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easier to Understand:** Pure functions are easier to understand because they don’t change any state and depend only on the input given to them. The output is always the return value, and their function signature gives all the information about them (arguments and return type).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions as Values:** The ability to treat functions as values and pass them as parameters makes code more readable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easier Testing and Debugging:** Since pure functions only use arguments and produce outputs (without side effects), testing and debugging are simpler. Immutable values make it easier to track down problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrency/Parallelism:** Pure functions don’t change variables or data outside of themselves, making it easier to implement concurrency and parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation:** Functional programming adopts lazy evaluation, which avoids repeated evaluation by computing values only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Disadvantages of Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability:** Sometimes, writing pure functions can reduce the readability of code, especially for those unfamiliar with the paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion Over Loops:** Writing programs in a recursive style (instead of using loops) can be intimidating and less intuitive for some programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with I/O:** While writing pure functions is easy, combining them with the rest of the application and handling I/O operations can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:** Immutable values and recursion can sometimes lead to decreased performance compared to imperative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Applications of Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Computations:** Widely used in domains requiring complex mathematical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Essential in systems where concurrent or parallel processing is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Industry Example:** WhatsApp leverages functional programming concepts to achieve high reliability and scalability. Remarkably, with just around 90 engineers, the platform supports over 900 million users. This efficiency is a testament to the power of functional programming."

    "## 3. Difference Between Object-Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) represent different approaches to software design. Here’s a comparison of key aspects:\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Focus**         | Encapsulates state and behavior within objects. State is mutable and can be changed by methods.   | Focuses on pure functions and immutability. State is not changed directly. |\n",
    "| **State Management** | State is managed within objects and can be modified by methods.                                 | State is managed through function arguments and return values; data is immutable. |\n",
    "| **Modularity**    | Achieved through classes and objects; methods define behavior, attributes define state.           | Achieved through pure functions and function composition; data is passed between functions. |\n",
    "| **Data Handling** | Data and behavior are bundled together in objects; state changes occur through methods.           | Data is immutable and managed through function applications.             |\n",
    "| **Code Reusability** | Achieved through inheritance and polymorphism; classes can be extended and methods overridden.  | Achieved through higher-order functions; functions can be passed as arguments and returned from other functions. |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "+ OOP is best when you need to model complex entities with mutable state and behavior.\n",
    "+ FP is best when you want predictable, testable code with minimal side effects and easy parallelization."
