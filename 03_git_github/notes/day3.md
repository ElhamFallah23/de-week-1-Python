### What I learned about Git
- How to creat a new branch for each task using 'Git checkout -b',and why it is important to keep work isolated.
- How to stay updated by syncing with the main course repo using 'git fetch upstream', 'git merge upstream/main',and then 'git push origin main'.
- How to stage, commit, and push changes and finally open a Pull Request(PR) to share my work.

### My question 
- When should I use 'rebase' instead of 'merge'?
