    "## 1. Introduction to Error Handling\n",
    "### 1.1. What is Error Handling?\n",
    "Error handling is the process of managing problems that occur while your program is running. These problems—called **exceptions**—can happen for many reasons: trying to open a file that doesn’t exist, dividing by zero, or passing the wrong type of input to a function.\n",
    "Error handling is an essential aspect of software development that ensures the smooth functioning of programs and applications. It involves anticipating and addressing potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program. By implementing effective error handling techniques, developers can improve the reliability and stability of their software, leading to a better user experience. In this section, we will delve into the fundamentals of error handling, exploring various strategies and best practices to handle errors efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to catch these exceptions and decide what to do when they happen. Instead of letting your program crash, you can handle errors gracefully—logging the issue, showing a helpful message, or taking a different path in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Why is Error Handling Important?\n",
    "- **Prevents Crashes**: Helps avoid abrupt program termination when something unexpected happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improves User Experience:** Gives users clear feedback instead of confusing error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Makes Debugging Easier**: Proper error handling often points you straight to the source of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enables Robust Programs:** Programs that handle exceptions well are more reliable in real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, error handling is not just about fixing bugs—it's about writing code that anticipates problems and responds to them intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Errors vs. Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Errors, particularly Syntax Errors, represent fundamental issues in the program's structure that prevent the Python interpreter from even understanding the code. They violate the grammatical rules of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When they occur:** These errors are typically detected by the interpreter before the program starts executing (during the parsing phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program (at runtime) that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They indicate that something unexpected or problematic happened that the program couldn't handle within its current logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When they occur:** These are runtime errors. The code might be syntactically correct, but an issue arises when the code tries to perform an operation that is impossible or invalid given the current state or data.\n"

    "## 2. Why Error Handling Matters in Data Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Data work is unpredictable by nature. Files can be missing, formats might change, APIs can time out, and inputs can be dirty or malformed. If you don’t handle these cases properly, even a small issue can cause an entire data pipeline, analysis script, or machine learning model to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore a few key reasons why proper error handling is essential in data projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Is Often Messy or Incomplete\n",
    "\n",
    " Real-world data frequently has missing values, unexpected types, or outliers.\n",
    " Without error handling, your code might break on a single unexpected value—causing you to lose hours of processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "A CSV column that usually contains numbers might suddenly have a string like \"N/A.\" If your code blindly tries to convert it to an integer, it will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Automation Requires Resilience\n",
    "\n",
    " Data scripts often run on a schedule (daily, hourly, etc.) as part of pipelines.\n",
    " One unhandled exception can stop an entire automated job and potentially delay reports or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "With error handling, you can:\n",
    "- Retry failed operations.\n",
    "- Log the issue.\n",
    "- Continue processing unaffected parts of the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### C. APIs, Databases, and External Systems Are Not Always Reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code that connects to an external system (like a REST API or database) is vulnerable to timeouts, downtime, or rate limits.\n",
    "Proper error handling lets you catch these failures and either retry or fail gracefully without data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Debugging Is Easier With Clear Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    " When errors are logged with context, it’s much easier to trace the issue.\n",
    " Instead of vague or cryptic messages, good error handling can include:\n",
    "  - The failing dataset or row\n",
    "  - The function or line of code\n",
    "  - The nature of the exception\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Trust in Your Code Matters\n",
    "\n",
    " If you're working in a team or delivering results to stakeholders, they need to trust that your code will run reliably.\n",
    " Transparent and well-handled errors build that trust and help you scale your work to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, good error handling doesn’t just prevent crashes. It ensures data workflows are stable, predictable, and easier to debug—all essential traits for real-world data science and engineering."

    "       - Password is at least 8 characters long.\n",
    "       - Contains at least one digit.\n",
    "       - Contains at least one special character (`!@#$%^&*()`).\n",
    "       - Raise `InvalidPasswordError` if invalid.\n",

    "#### Step 3: **Create the Registration Function**\n",
    "   - Implement `register_user(username, password)` that:\n",
    "       - Calls both validation functions.\n",
    "       - Handles exceptions using try-except blocks.\n",
    "       - Prints appropriate messages for each error type.\n",

    "#### Step 4: **Demonstrate the Functionality**\n",
    "   - Test `register_user` with various valid and invalid username/password combinations.\n",

    "## Activity 2: Creating a Calculator and Raising Custom Exceptions\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "To build a command-line calculator in Python that handles user input errors and arithmetic issues using custom exceptions (`InvalidInputError`, `DivisionByZeroError`), ensuring robust and readable error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This activity helps reinforce how to raise and handle custom exceptions in Python. You will implement a basic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Along the way, you'll apply best practices in error handling, including catching and raising specific exceptions for invalid input and division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "You may solve the activity in your Colab notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1. **Define Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Create two custom exceptions:\n",
    "       - `InvalidInputError`: Raised when user inputs are not valid numbers.\n",
    "       - `DivisionByZeroError`: Raised when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2. **Implement the `calculate()` Function**\n",
    "   - Accept three inputs: two numbers as strings, and an operation name (`\"add\"`, `\"subtract\"`, `\"multiply\"`, `\"divide\"`).\n",
    "   - Convert string inputs to floats.\n",
    "   - Raise `InvalidInputError` if conversion fails.\n",
    "   - Raise `DivisionByZeroError` for division by zero.\n",
    "   - Raise `ValueError` for unsupported operations.\n",
    "   - Return the result of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3. **Demonstrate the Function**\n",
    "   - Use a main block to test the function with several inputs.\n",
    "   - Use try-except blocks to catch and print meaningful error messages for each exception type.\n",
    "   - Include test cases that trigger each kind of exception and a few successful cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4. **Run and Observe**\n",
    "   - Run the script to verify correct behavior.\n",
    "   - Check that all exceptions are caught and appropriate messages are printed.\n"
