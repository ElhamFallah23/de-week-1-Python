    "## 1. Why Does Performance Matter?\n",
    "Python's great for getting things done quickly, but is it fast? Isn't that what C++ or Java is for?' And you're not wrong to some extent. Python is often seen as a friendly, easy-going language. It's like the comfortable, spacious SUV of programming languages – great for getting everyone and everything where it needs to go without too much fuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the kicker: even an SUV can be optimized. You can lighten the load, tune the engine, and pick the right tires. That's precisely what we're going to do with your Python code. We're not trying to turn your SUV into a Formula 1 car – that's an entirely different vehicle. We're aiming to make your SUV remarkably efficient, capable of handling bigger trips and heavier loads, and getting there without breaking the bank or leaving your passengers frustrated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **E-commerce site**: Every second of page load time matters. Slow pages drive users away, costing real money.\n",
    "- **IoT and sensor data processing**: Laggy scripts can cause missed insights, memory overflows, or server crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance becomes critical in production, and it’s not just about speed – it’s about *balance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Why is Performance Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Slow applications lead to frustration and abandonment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize to reduce infrastructure costs (CPU, RAM, network).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Efficient code scales better as data or user load increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Developer Productivity**: Understanding performance leads to better architectural decisions from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. What are Python's Strengths & Perceived Weaknesses with Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths:** Readability, vast libraries, quick prototyping, strong community.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** The weaknesses of Python are often exaggerated or misunderstood, including the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), dynamic typing overhead, and its interpreted nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The Three Key Tradeoffs of Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>A. Speed</summary>\n",
    "This is the obvious one. How fast does your code run? Nobody likes waiting. Think about that spinning wheel on a website – it's a productivity killer and a user experience nightmare. In a professional setting, slow code can result in missed deadlines, unhappy clients, or even losing out to a competitor whose system is faster.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>B. Memory</summary>\n",
    "This is about resource efficiency. Your computer, server, or even your phone only has so much RAM. If your code is a memory hog, it's like trying to fit a jumbo jet into a bicycle shed. You'll run out of space, the system will slow down, or crash. In the cloud era, more memory usage often means higher bills – a direct hit to the budget.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>C. Readability</summary>\n",
    "You might write the fastest, most memory-efficient code in the world, but if no one, including your future self, can understand it six months later, it's a liability. It's like a brilliantly tuned race car that only one person in the world knows how to drive or fix. We want code that's not just fast, but also maintainable and extensible. This is where the 'tradeoffs' come in – sometimes, the absolute fastest way isn't the clearest. Our goal is to find that sweet spot, where performance is excellent, but your team can still easily debug and build upon it.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. What is The Iterative Process of Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure (Profile) -> Identify Bottleneck -> Optimize -> Measure (Verify). Emphasize that optimization is not a one-time thing.\n",

    "## 2. Introduction to Time Complexity: Best to Worst\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a problem in Python, you might come up with several different solutions. But how do you know which one is better? Time complexity is a tool that helps you judge and compare different codes, especially when preparing for interviews or building scalable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common misconception is that time complexity is about how long a program takes to run on your computer. In reality, it’s not about the actual seconds or milliseconds on your machine because that can change depending on your hardware. Instead, time complexity measures **how the running time of your code grows as the input size increases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. **What is Time Complexity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Time complexity describes how the time required to run an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. It’s a way to predict performance, regardless of the machine you’re running on.\n",
    "   - **Why not use actual time?** Running the same code on a slow laptop and a high-end server will give you different results. Time complexity ignores hardware and focuses on the growth rate as input size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example:**  \n",

    "A. **Why Analyze Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Scalability:** Predict how your code will behave with large inputs.\n",
    "   - **Efficiency:** Compare different solutions without running them on every possible machine.\n",
    "   - **Best Choice:** Choose the most efficient algorithm for your needs.\n",

    "<summary>Worst Case Analysis (Most Common)</summary>  \n",
    "     - **What is it?**  \n",
    "       This is the scenario where your algorithm takes the **maximum possible number of steps** to complete. Think of it as the \"slowest\" your code could ever be, no matter what input you give it.\n",
    "     - **Why use it?**  \n",
    "       It gives you a **guaranteed upper limit**—so you know your code will never be slower than this, even in the most challenging situations.\n",
    "     - **Example:**  \n",
    "       Imagine searching for a number in a list. In the worst case, the number isn’t present at all, so your code has to check **every single item** before giving up.\n",

    "<summary> Best Case Analysis (Rarely Used)</summary>   \n",

    "       This is the scenario where your algorithm finishes in the **fewest possible steps**. It’s the \"luckiest\" situation for your code.\n",
    "     - **Why not use it?**  \n",
    "       While it sounds nice, it’s not very practical—just because your code is fast in the best case doesn’t mean it will be fast most of the time.\n",
    "     - **Example:**  \n",
    "       In a linear search, the best case is when the element you’re looking for is **right at the start** of the list. Only one check is needed!\n",

    "<summary> Average Case Analysis (Sometimes Used)</summary>   \n",
    "     - **What is it?**  \n",

    "     - **Why is it tricky?**  \n",
